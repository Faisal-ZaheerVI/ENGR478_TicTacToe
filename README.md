<h1> Tic Tac Toe </h1>
<h5> By Faisal Zaheer and Zamar Bravo </h5>

<h4> Project Goal </h4> 
<p>
  The goal of our project was to recreate the classic Tic Tac Toe game using a LCD output device to customize the look of the game and a joystick input device using ADC interrupts to implement a more interactive component to Tic Tac Toe.

<h4>Rules</h4>
<ul>
  <li>User selects a position on the 3x3 board using the joystick control, and then confirms the position using the switch (SW2) on the Tiva launchpad.</li>
  <li>Then, a programmed computer will choose a random, unoccupied position to choose from on the board, then the user can select another position after. </li>
  <li>After any selection, the game board on the LCD will update with the current board and its updated positions.</li>
  <li>The user and computer will then play back and forth until the program detects a win condition after every turn by checking for three of the same sign (X or O) in a row in any of various directions (vertically, horizontally, and diagonally).</li>
</ul>
